# KYS Test Completion Rates: Data-Driven User Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior data to identify and address key drop-off points in the KYS (Know Your Self) test funnel of an EdTeach Platform. By leveraging SQL for data exploration and proposing actionable solutions, this project aims to enhance test completion rates and improve user experience.

---

## Objective
- To analyze user behavior patterns in the KYS test funnel using SQL and identify critical drop-off stages.
- To propose and evaluate solutions basked by data.

---

## Key Analyses Performed
1. **Funnel Drop-off Analysis**
   - Identified stages in the test funnel where users are most likely to abandon the process.
   - Calculated stage-wise conversion and drop-off rates using SQL.
   
2. **Time-to-Action Analysis**
   - Measured the time difference between when users first see the test and when they attempt it.
   - Assessed user behavior patterns for scheduling or delayed test completions.

3. **Resumption Rate Analysis**
   - Tracked and analyzed user behavior for resuming dropped-off tests.
   - Compared effectiveness of personalized reminders on resumption rates.

4. **Engagement Metrics Evaluation**
   - Measured user engagement by tracking milestone completion and interaction rates.

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Splitting the Test into Sections**
   - Divided the test into two manageable sections with progress bars and milestone messaging to reduce cognitive load.
   - Enhanced user motivation by showcasing progress dynamically.

2. **Automated Reminder Strategies**
   - Designed automated re-engagement messages via emails and WhatsApp.
   - Personalized content based on the user's drop-off stage, improving resumption rates.

3. **Test Scheduling Feature**
   - Enabled users to schedule their test at a convenient time.
   - Introduced an optional automated phone reminder system for additional accountability.

## Results
- Increased test completion rates by addressing cognitive load and engagement barriers.
- Improved resumption rates through targeted reminders and milestone-based nudges.
- Enhanced decision-making for stakeholders with actionable insights from dashboards.
